# Introduction

In urban areas, efforts to improve air quality often involve creative solutions, such as implementing "school streets" to reduce pollution around schools. This analysis aims to measure the impact of such interventions on air quality by examining changes in pollutant levels during designated intervention periods. Data from twelve schools across eleven wards in Bradford have been collected, focusing on pollutants like Nitric Oxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), PM1, PM<sub>10</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub>.

The study initially covers a three-month period, starting from June 8th, 2023, to September 20th, 2023, during which the school street initiative was implemented. This initiative aims to reduce pollution during two key times: the morning drop-off and afternoon pick-up periods. Based on similar programs in London and insights from a local study, the intervention times have been estimated to be from 7:45 AM to 9:15 AM for drop-offs and from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM for pick-ups, with the intention of refining these times as the data is analyzed.

The analysis is approached from three angles: descriptive, time series, and spatial analyses. Descriptively, a thorough overview of each pollutant's concentration across all schools will be provided, using common statistical measures like averages, medians, and ranges.

Next, the time aspect will be explored, examining how pollutant levels change over the three-month period. Statistical tests will be employed to determine if there are significant differences in pollutant concentrations between intervention and non-intervention periods.

Finally, spatial variations in air quality will be explored by using interpolation techniques to estimate pollutant concentrations in areas where direct data collection was not possible. By combining these methods, insights can be gained to guide future efforts to improve air quality in urban environments.

# Summary of Air pollutants

This section presents an analysis focused on determining key summary statistics for various air pollutants.

Furthermore, we aim to characterize the average pollutant concentrations for each individual school, offering valuable insights into the distribution of pollutants within our study area.

# Statistical trend analysis

This study employs time series analysis to investigate the influence of School Streets road closures on air quality surrounding identified schools. Due to the unavailability of pre-intervention data, establishing baseline concentrations for comparison was not feasible. Consequently, the analysis focuses on examining differences in the diurnal profile of pollutant concentrations across various monitoring sites during periods of School Streets road closures.

Drawing inspiration from the methodology employed in the London School Streets Air Quality Monitoring study, the impact of interventions is assessed by comparing pollutant concentrations when School Streets were closed against times when they were not. Notably, unlike the London study, this analysis lacks monitoring sites without interventions. Therefore, comparisons are made between periods of intervention and non-intervention, providing insights into the unique air quality dynamics surrounding the participating schools.

By aligning the methodology with established frameworks while adapting it to the research context, the aim is to provide valuable insights into the efficacy of School Streets interventions in mitigating air pollution. This comparative approach enhances the robustness of the findings and contributes to the growing body of literature on urban air quality management strategies. 

According to the City of the Bradford Metropolitan Council, the current opening and closing time are 08:45am and 03:00pm respectively. Therefore giving ample drop off time and pickup time before and after closing time, and taking reference from the London School Streets Air quality Monitoring study and insights from a local study, the intervention times have been estimated to be from **7:45am to 9:15am** for drop-offs and from **2:30pm to 4:30pm** for pick-ups, with the intention of refining these times as the data is analyzed.

Due to further investigation of each school's starting and closing time, the following school had a different School Street intervention period due to a different closing and/or opening time.

1.    Cavendish Primary School; start time 7:45am

## Average Diurnal Profiles of Pollutants at Each School Site during School term

This analysis presents the average diurnal profiles of pollutants measured at various school sites. The methodology involves averaging pollutant concentrations across timestamps, resulting in a single average concentration for each time of day. Specifically, concentrations measured at 7:15am, for instance, are aggregated to derive a representative average concentration for that time slot. This averaging process is restricted to term times which will include weekends because of the lack of daily distinction in the datasets, with data from half-term weeks, and school breaks excluded from the analysis.

To estimate term times, school term time was collected from several schools including Cavendish Primary School, Farfield Primary School, Thackley Primary School, as well as schools located within a one-mile radius of East Bowling such as Bowling Park Primary School and Rainbow Primary Leadership Academy. Additionally, school termtime from All Saints CofE Primary School in GT Horton was collected. Access to term time data prior to September resumption was not always feasible. The estimated term times for schools within a one-mile radius of the school street are as follows:

School opening: June 5th to July 21st
School closed: July 24th to September 1st
School reopened: September 5th to September 20th

These estimated term times serve as the basis for the diurnal profile analysis, allowing for the identification of temporal patterns in pollutant concentrations during school term periods.

```

From the graphs above, there is not a distinct drop in air pollutants for any of the diurnal profiles  during the first term time of the three months period of the survey so far.  

It should be noted that the morning road closures typically coincide with the peak traffic period, while the afternoon closures do not, occurring well before 5pm. As a result, it would be reasonable to expect the afternoon road closures to have less effect on pollutant concentrations than those in the morning.

## Average Diurnal Profiles of Pollutants at Each School Site Throughout the Three-Month Period
